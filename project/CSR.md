row offsets or row ptr is number of non-zero accumulated until this row.

Advantages
- Efficient arithmetic operations CSR + CSR, CSR Ã— CSR, etc.
- Efficient row slicing.
- Fast matrix vector products.

Disadvantages
- Slow column slicing operations.
- Changes to the sparsity structure are expensive.
